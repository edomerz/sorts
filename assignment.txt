counting sort
radix sort
stable sort( no swap if the certiria is equal between 2 elements )

 implement counting sort and radix in sorts.c
 
void CountingSort(void *base, 
				  size_t num_of_elements, 
				  size_t element_size, 
				  size_t(*produce_key)(const void *element, void *arg), 
				  void *arg,
				  size_t range);

the func pointer produce_key points to a function that produces a key in order to
be able to group,
every element maps to a integer key between the given range.

we send every element in our base array to the produce_key function,
that produce a key using the given arg,
the key is in the range given;
